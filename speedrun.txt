"Welcome to nightmare on campus"

There is no shotcut to finish this game because I make sure that everytime you launch the game,

All the papers that you need to find to uunlock the hiiden room, are in a different piece.

But the thing that I can tell you is that :

All the word or letter that you will find on those papers are listing to the left of the arrow,

and the decoding of the word or letter with the cesar number 3 is to the right of the arrow

s -> p
b -> y
w -> t
k -> h
d -> a
j -> g
r -> o
u -> r
h -> e
cesar
3
